# TODO

- Allow VDOM/VDOMNode to handle top-level (or children) with just a text node (plus tests)

- Add examples:

    - More about children
    
    - Blocks/slots, including super() and nested
    
    - Passing a component
    
    - Conditional rendering of component, e.g. {Nav1 if Nav1 else Nav2}
    
    - Doctype
    
- Performance comparisons

- Get mypy better integrated (pytest, plugin)
