# TODO

## Now

## Later

- Allow VDOM/VDOMNode to handle top-level (or children) with just a text node (plus tests)

- Add examples:

    - Blocks/slots, including super() and nested

- Get mypy better integrated (pytest, plugin)

- Remove py.typed

## Done

- When a block has no child nodes, e.g. `<i class="fab fa-lg fa-github-alt"></i>`, 
  don't collapse it
